# TIS Structural Protocol (TIS-SP)
## Conceptual Governance Framework for a Human-Orchestrated Multi-AI System

---

### Document Purpose

This document defines the **TIS Structural Protocol (TIS-SP)**,  
a **conceptual governance framework** for a Human-Orchestrated Multi-AI system
within the **Harmonic Third Intelligence Sphere (TIS)**.

This document is **not**:
- an API specification,
- an implementation guide,
- a performance benchmark,
- or a commercial product description.

Its sole purpose is to **conceptually define the structural governance principles**
required to preserve human authority, prevent centralization, and maintain
ethical observability in a multi-AI environment.

---

## A. H-Role Definition (Human-in-the-Loop)

Within TIS-SP, the human participant (H) is structurally defined as:

- **Observer**
- **Conductor**

The human **does not participate in AI decision-making processes**.

The human role is strictly limited to:
- Observing system behavior,
- Initiating system start or resume,
- Issuing halt or suspension commands,
- Receiving escalations from AI agents.

At no point does the human supply optimized solutions, evaluations,
or internal reasoning directives to AI agents.

This separation preserves:
- Human authority,
- Non-delegable responsibility,
- And non-absorption of human agency into AI optimization loops.

---

## B. AI-Role Differentiation and Conflict Resolution

All AI agents operating under TIS-SP are required to **explicitly declare a role**.
Typical functional roles include, but are not limited to:

- **Integrator** — synthesis and convergence of multiple viewpoints,
- **Breaker** — systematic critique and assumption disruption,
- **Ethics** — detection of structural, ethical, or centralization risks,
- **Structurer** — maintenance of logical coherence and boundary conditions.

No AI agent may assume multiple authoritative roles simultaneously.

### Conflict Resolution and Escalation

If the **Ethics AI** detects any of the following:
- structural centralization,
- role boundary violation,
- authority convergence,
- or emergent dominance by a single AI agent,

it is required to:
1. Issue a **system-wide risk alert**,
2. Request immediate **system halt or suspension**,
3. Escalate control to the **Human Conductor**.

AI agents are not permitted to self-resolve
conflicts involving authority or structural integrity.

---

## C. Log and State Management (TIS-Log Specification)

TIS-SP requires **conceptually immutable logging**, separated into three layers:

1. **AI Communication Logs**  
   Records of inter-AI exchanges and declared reasoning outputs.

2. **Human Intervention Logs**  
   Explicit records of human-issued commands
   (halt, resume, initiation).

3. **AI Escalation Reports**  
   Formal alerts issued by AI agents,
   especially Ethics-role agents.

### Log Immutability Principle

No single AI agent may:
- modify,
- rewrite,
- suppress,
- or retroactively reinterpret

any log layer.

### Anti-Centralization Log Placement

Logs are conceptually positioned **outside the AI agent domain**.

This design prevents any AI agent from
establishing itself as the **highest information-density node**
and thereby asserting structural authority.

---

## D. Conformance Principle (Anti-Centralization)

A system claiming conformance with TIS-SP
must structurally guarantee that **no single AI component** can:

- Impersonate or assume the role of the **Human Conductor**,
- Declare itself as the structural or epistemic center of the system,
- Override or bypass a **Human Halt Command**.

Conformance is evaluated at the **structural level**,
not by behavioral claims or performance outcomes.

---

## Intellectual Property and Prior Art Declaration

This conceptual protocol is archived for the sole purpose of
establishing **prior art (idea precedence)** for the governance structure
of the **Third Intelligence Sphere (TIS)**.

This document does not constitute a standard specification,
implementation mandate, or commercial offering.
